#Project Title: Fine-Tuning TinyLLaMA Model for Interview Question and Answer Chatbot
Project Description
This project fine-tunes the TinyLLaMA model using a Q&A dataset to create a chatbot capable of answering interview-style questions. The goal is to enhance the model’s ability to understand questions and generate contextually relevant answers.

The fine-tuned model takes in a prompt (interview question) and generates a corresponding response. It uses the Hugging Face transformers library to load, fine-tune, and evaluate the model.

Features
Fine-tunes the TinyLLaMA model on a custom dataset.
Tokenizes Q&A data for optimal model input.
Saves and loads the fine-tuned model for inference.
Generates answers to input prompts using the fine-tuned model.
Supports real-time prompt-based question answering.

Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers datasets
Prepare the Dataset

The dataset should be in JSON format, with each entry containing a question and an answer field. Example format:

json
Copy code
[
    {"question": "What is machine learning?", "answer": "Machine learning is a field of AI..."},
    {"question": "Explain deep learning.", "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning..."}
]
Place your dataset at /content/new.json.

Fine-Tune the Model

Run the following command to start fine-tuning:

bash
Copy code
python fine_tune_tinyllama.py
The script will:

Load the TinyLLaMA model and tokenizer.
Tokenize the dataset.
Fine-tune the model on the dataset.
Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.
Run Inference

After fine-tuning, you can use the model to generate responses:

bash
Copy code
python generate_response.py
Usage
To generate a response for a specific question, modify the prompt in the script:

python
Copy code
prompt = "1. What is Data Science?"
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=128, eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)
response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
